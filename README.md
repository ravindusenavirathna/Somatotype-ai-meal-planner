## Features

- **Body Type Prediction**: Uses a Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression) to classify body types based on gender and anthropometric measurements.
- **Personalized Meal Plans**: Generates 7-day meal plans tailored to your body type and fitness goal (Muscle Gain, Weight Loss, Maintenance) using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- **Interactive UI**: Clean and responsive frontend to input data and view results.
- **Meal Swapping**: Option to swap meal choices between main and alternative options.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **ML Model**: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package manager)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Body-Type
    ```

2.  **Run the Setup Script:**
    This script will create a virtual environment, install all dependencies (Python & Node.js), and help you configure your `.env` file.

    ```bash
    setup.bat
    ```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server

The backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`.

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 2. Start the Frontend

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and start a simple HTTP server.

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8080
```
